We saw as expected that the run times increased as the value of n became larger. These run times were in line to the asymptotic bounds. Quick sort had a worst case of O(n^2) and an average of n.logn . Whereas selection sort had a worst case of O(n^2) , therefore it was expected to see the run time increase as the value of n increased. When the type of input list was changed it changed the performance of these algorithms. Selection sort was faster for sorted lists and quick sort was faster for unsorted lists

After the tests , we found that Tim sort was significantly faster than q sort. It showed that the worst case was O(n.logn). Tim sort ran quicker for sorted lists. This makes sense , because it optimized to run on nearly sorted or sorted lists this is probably because it is a combination of merge sort and insertion sort.
